# DofE-proof
Where my proof for completing my D of E bronze skills section will go. I needed to put in (on average) an hour of work per week between the week commencing (w/c) from the 14/12/14 to the w/c 15/3/15.

# Github work
## AChat
(roughly from the w/c 14/12/14 to w/c 21/12/14)

This is a project I started before my D of E, where I used the Firebase databases to create a simple messaging system. During the D of E, I attempted to add a group message system and set it up for android.

More recently, I started some android programming in android studio which related to the AChat app (more on that later).

## N-body problem
(roughly from w/c 18/1/15 to w/c 22/2/15)

This is a project I started during the D of E period to simulate the motions of bodies under each other's gravitational effects. It started out with the first week and a half being the figuring out of the mathematical functions, then subsequent weeks being improvements to the systems efficiency and aesthetics.

I did attempt to make a web based version of the program but I struggled to figure out the javascript canvas functions - and promptly stopped and moved on to a different project.

## solLog
(roughly from w/c 22/2/15 to w/c 1/3/15)

This project was meant to be a way to test out the use of a node.js server with a simple database. It turned into a project where users were meant to be able to create digital 'diary' entries. The system to log the diary entries worked, but I had problems with the login system as I couldn't return the values I needed when reading the user's details from the database.

## Perlin noise generator
(roughly from w/c 28/12/14 to w/c 4/1/14)

This was a small program designed to create a 2 dimensional Perlin noise pattern. There is both a 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional version of the program (I started with the 1 dimensional program). It can easily be scaled between larger and smaller grids and to also have the same outcome each time depending on the user's input.

## Android programming
(roughly from w/c 8/3/15 to w/c 15/3/15)

I have recently started a small bit of android programming in android studio after discovering how to access developer controls on my tablet. Currently, I have only made 3 small apps:
+ one that reads what the user has inputted, displays it to the user and changes the text on a button each time it's pressed.
+ one that writes data to my Firebase database - users for the AChat app, with a username and password.
+ one to write messages to the AChat app - it currently requires the input of a username instead of logging in and having it saved.

# Other things
## Treehouse
(roughly from w/c 11/1/15 to w/c 25/1/15)

I signed up for the free two week trial of the Treehouse learning platform. In the two weeks, I completed the basic Java course (where you learn how to write a hangman program as well as how to program in Java in general) and started the basic android course (a simple fact-displaying app).
